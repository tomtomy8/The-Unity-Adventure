# The-Unity-Adventure
My attempt at making a Unity RPG style game. I'm using Unity as I love it as a game engine but I haven't heard of anyone
making this sort of game using it.

For graphics I'm using the graphic engine 'Tiled' and the LPC resources. 

Please note: you will find the LPC tiles under /TMX/Tilesets. If you try an open the TMX files in tiled
you're going to get an error message as when I created the first four (hero_house_exterior, overworld, castle_town,
int_hole) then its not going to work. If someone could correct this I will be extreamly happy.

I am really a nube at Unity compared to some people I know, so if anyone has any ideas about better game styes,
gameplay, or even music/graphics please make a pull request and unless it deletes the whole game and replaces it with
a troll face then I will be happy to accept it.
